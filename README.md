# Smart Street Light Using Arduino

## 📌 Objective
To automatically control street lights using LDR sensor and Arduino.

## 🧰 Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- 10kΩ Resistor
- LED
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires

## ⚙️ Working Principle
The LDR senses light intensity.
When it becomes dark, the resistance increases.
Arduino reads the analog value.
If the value is below threshold, LED turns ON.
If the value is above threshold, LED turns OFF.

## 💡 Applications
- Smart Cities
- Energy Saving Systems
- Automatic Outdoor Lighting
